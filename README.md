# Plan for Building


### 1. Build GUI
- side by side Web interface + windows GUI
- Hook this up to whisper for voice to text command

### 2. Try different GPTs
- Run different versions of GPTs rather than 3.5 turbo commands (like GPT-4)

### 3. Try vision models
- Take photo the drone takes and then process that into answering certain instruction based questions like GPT-4
- If we have time, switch this out for a fancy model like LLaVA

### 4. Implement 'flutter'
- So the drones aren't sitting ducks for targets
- Oscillates
- STRETCH* a version where if it is a swarm, it moves in a confusing swarm pattern

### 5. Multiple drones/objects
- Multiple drones swarming to one object at once. 
- Detect multiple objects
- Not just turbines and people (try other objects)

### 6. New environment 
- Switch out the environment

## Interesting Tasks: 
- Counting tasks
- Following objects
